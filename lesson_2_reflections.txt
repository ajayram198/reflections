What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
We initalize a repository so that Git can start tracking these files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is like an intermediate between the untracked file and the committed file. It helps us to remove files if they have been accidentally chosen for a commit, so you can add/remove files from staging area before making the commit.
